# Hackercat
Some stupid script to make Hackercat full screen and talk to you. If you are on a closed network you can use hax.html and meow.gif in order to use this script. Though you need to change this in the hackercat.ps1 itself. Just comment out the normal use and uncomment the following two lines.
